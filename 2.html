                    We had been rolling 7 or 8 hours every day for the past week. From my perspective, the United States is a mix of corn fields,
                    water towers, fireworks shop, truck stops and giant billboard signs.

                    came to see the show. We drove for about an hour in the night after. While sleeping, a huge pickle jar
                    fell off the counter directly on Maxx's face.

                    Terrific show yesterday at the
                    <a href="https://www.cactusclubmilwaukee.com/">Cactus</a> in Milwaukee. The bar was at 2 minutes from the great lakes. The stage looked like the second
                    level of Guitar Hero. So far, the RV is doing well even in bigger cities. Can't wait to see it tomorrow
                    in Minnesota.

                    Total panic mode today as the stereo system broke down. After dismounting half of the RV's face, we finally fixed it. Mario,
                    the freak who sold us the RV, has done quite good damage on the electric systems. We find small fragments
                    of his genius ideas once a while when something fails.

                    Des Moines was almost as hot as Sleazy Boby yesterday with a whopping 98F outside. We rocked the

                    Omaha is literally in the middle of the US. Since it is flat, straight and really hot outside, the 8 hour drive was hardcore.
                    However, the

                    After 10 days and 2000 miles, we encountered our first issue with the RV. The main battery was discharged, leaking acid all
                    over the battery compartment. The sleazy RV wouldn't start anymore. Luckily, we found an auto shop near
                    the venue and Taylor repaired it. We are now back on track, ready to hit the road again.
                    <br> The
                    <a href="https://fubarstl.com/">FUBAR</a> is a cool venue, especially with our VIP lounge parked straight in front of the main door.
                    As Saint-Louis is a free-drinking city, we had a few cold ones right out there on the sidewalk.
