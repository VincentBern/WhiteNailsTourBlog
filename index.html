                <p>Gozu's singer invited us at his place near Hudson for a BBQ. The man knows how to grill. The show yesterday
                    was at Ralph's Diner in Worcester and we are already heading to Providence for our last show with GOZU
                    before leaving for Georgia. We had some time to kill this afternoon so we went to the beach. We grilled
                    chicken on a public charcoal there. Smooth.</p>

                <p>We played our first show tonight, it was great. Jon from Geno's Rock Clubs was welcoming and helped us organize
                    the rig. Even if The Sword and The Descendents were playing the same night in Portland, we ended up having
                    a nice crowd. However, I honestly think GOZU stole the show, those guys rocks as hell. They invited us
                    to park Berta at their place tonight, we ended up partying with them. I got bullied by a butterfly on
                    steroids near the fire pit.</p>

                <p>We crossed the border without any problems, surprisingly. Officers at the Jackman border were really friendly.
                    We tried to fuel up the RV in Jackman, but we slightly bumped in the garage with our vehicle. The lady
                    shut down the light right away, so we ran out of gas before reaching Portland. We ended up in
                    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/KennebecRiverBrewery/">a bar in The Forks</a> and slept in a parking lot. The RV is like a high-end hotel on wheels, it is a
                    wonderful machine. Darcy is driving us to Portland, we should be there at 11 A.M. Our first show is scheduled
                    for tonight at
                    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/genosportland/">Geno's Rock Club</a>.</p>

                <p>Things are now real. WhiteNails is on tour. We left a few minutes ago with Berta, our magnificent 1990 Ford
                    RV. We are heading toward Portland, Maine. We’ll reach the border in a few hours, can’t wait to see how
                    this it gonna go. I’m not stressed, we look like a typical family in a RV after all.</p>

                <p>Bags are packed, everything is ready. We downloaded a ton of music and movies for the road. We are leaving
                    home tomorrow.</p>

                <img src="tour.png" />
                <p>Once all the dates settled, we plotted all the venues on the map. Here's then plan: 8,684 miles across 24
                    cities spread through North America. We'll have to cross the borders 4 times. With an average 5 hours
                    drive each day, we are truly gonna live on the road for a whole month.</p>

                <p>Here's the official poster of the tour with Black Tusk and WHORES. We accepted gigs with GOZU on our way
                    to Atlanta as well, so the few first gigs will happen in New England.</p>

                <p>Who knew how much details needed to be aligned before leaving. In addition to getting valid visas, we had
                    to find a vehicle, a trailer, and fill up the merch. We printed new designs, pins, stickers, and got
                    new vinyls. Each of us had to get their passports up to date, and deal with our jobs to get time off.</p>

                <h5>July 24 2018</h5>
                <p>About 2 and a half month ago, a crazy opportunity just popped in our mailbox. Touring with Black Tusk and
                    WHORES for a full month. Ready or not, we decided to jump in and accepted right away. Here's the full
                    story behind the 2018 summer tour.</p>
