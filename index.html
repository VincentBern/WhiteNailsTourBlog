                    People at the <a href="https://www.kungfunecktie.com/">Kung Fu Necktie</a> were packed like sardines. The show was amazing, a lot of friends came to see us play. The Philly cheese steaks from  <a href="https://www.joessteaks.com/">Joe's Steaks</a> were delicious, and then we ordered beers to go and had a party in the camping lot.

                    We found an <a href="http://campusparkandride.com/rv/">RV parking ground</a> near downtown Philadelphia. Even with the fully asphalted layout and the electrical wires all around the lot, our urban camping allowed us to visit Downtown Philly in the evening. We stopped at the <a href="https://readingterminalmarket.org/">Reading Terminal Market</a> to get amazing food. Some friends from  <a href="https://heavytemple.bandcamp.com/">Heavy Temple</a> invited us to their band house and gave us a live performance. Slick!

                    We went downtown New York today to visit the Big Apple during our last day off. We parked the rig in Jersey and took the
                    ferry to reach Manhattan. We did yoga in Central Park and had a green tea in Times Square (or maybe not).
                    We are now going back on the road to get to Philly for dinner.

                    As expected, the path to the
                    <a href="https://www.saintvitusbar.com/">Saint-Vitus</a> was a bit harder since we had to go through the New York metropolitan area with our rig.
                    After avoiding tolls, tunnels and hobos, we discovered the mythic venue downtown Brooklyn. The show was
                    sold out and fully packed. We ended up after the show in the green room giving French lessons to Casey
                    and Mark.

                    The
                    <a href="https://rpmfest.org/">RPM Fest</a> was definitely one of our best shows so far. The whole fest is located on a shooting range
                    in Montague. Three main stages are shared between more than 50 bands. We played on the largest stage
                    in front of a cool crowd. We even saw a unicorn dancing along with other campers.

                <p>The Canadian part of the tour is now over, we are going south again for the last 8 shows. The border crossing
                    was crowded and it took almost 2 hours to get through. One more time, we passed the border without any
                    problems. The road in Vermont is spectacular, the breeze is filling the van with Mother Nature's best
                    aromas.

                <p>Horny Montreal, we love you. The show was intense at
                    <a href="https://www.foufouneselectriques.com/">Les Foufounes Électriques</a>, we celebrated Whores' drummer birthday and went out for a wild night in
                    the city. We saw good friends, had good drinks, and played rock and roll like if there was no tomorrow.
