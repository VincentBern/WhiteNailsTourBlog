                <p>The Canadian part of the tour is now over, we are going south again for the last 8 shows. The border crossing was crowded and it took almost 2 hours to get through. One more time, we passed the border without any problems. The road in Vermont is spectacular, the breeze is filling the van with Mother Nature's best aromas.

                <p>Horny Montreal, we love you. The show was intense at <a href="https://www.foufouneselectriques.com/">Les Foufounes Électriques</a>, we celebrated Whores' drummer birthday and went out for a wild night in the city. We saw good friends, had good drinks, and played rock and roll like if there was no tomorrow.

                    We stopped at <a href="https://www.studiomandragore.com/">Mandragore</a> studio during the day to meet with old pals. This place is killing it, amazing people, gear and ambiance. Keep up the good work, boys!

                <p>Ottawa was our 17th show so far. The staff at <a href="http://www.mavericksbar.com/">Mavericks</a> helped unload all the gear. We warmed up the crowd and then Whores did their black magic sorcery stuff during their set. Black Tusk ended the night like warriors and we all got invited to <a href="https://thekoven.ca/">The Koven</a>, a cool metal restaurant located downtown Ottawa. Really cool night!

                <p>The RV is keeping up with the extreme conditions. We’ve been driving for more than 8,000 km. We take good care of the beast, using products for high-mileage vehicles.  A mirror almost fell off near Montebello, so Maxx decided to do a bit of hiking while we repaired our precious van.

                <p>Hard morning. We left our beautiful Quebec City to go to Ottawa. The day off was amazing after 12 shows in a row. It was so good to see our friends and family. We’re now ready to rock again!

                <p>We had hours and hours of pleasure parking the RV in Toronto. We rocked Lee's Palace pretty hard and are now heading to Quebec City for a day off. Darcy and Taylor will be driving all night so we can get home as soon as possible.
